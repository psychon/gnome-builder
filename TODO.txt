 - Search entry context menu (use a GMenu and merging this time)
   Might also require DzlWidgetActionGroup.

 - Make sure search entry actually works

 - Enter, Up, and Down accelerators for search/replace entries.

 - perspective focus_location

 - other perspective interface methods

 - can we make perspectives the plugin interface?

 - view-added/removed/etc on IdeLayoutGrid

 - Remove get_right_edge() etc, switch with "classification" for panels

 - Ability to disable plugin by default

 - Plugins to fix for API
   - devhelp
   - command bar / vim
   - project-tree
   - terminal
   - symbol-tree

 - Remove accelerators from perspective, use shortcut engine

 - Move panel position settings to org.gnome.builder.editor maybe



Done

 - Check if buffer is already in visible stack before adding new view
 - Perspective actions, copy them across
 - Be able to add an editor view
