 - Search entry context menu (use a GMenu and merging this time)
   Might also require DzlWidgetActionGroup.

 - Make sure search entry actually works
 - Enter, Up, and Down accelerators for search/replace entries.

 - other perspective interface methods

 - snippets are broken

 - can we make perspectives the plugin interface?

 - view-added/removed/etc on IdeLayoutGrid

 - Remove get_right_edge() etc, switch with "classification" for panels

 - Remove accelerators from perspective, use shortcut engine

 - Move panel position settings to org.gnome.builder.editor maybe

 - What to do about devhelp/color on right panel?

 - Escape in vim mode, keybindings in general.

 - New project tree based on stacklist
 - Ability to disable plugin by default (and disable treeview project tree)

 - Keybindings editor into preferences

 - Escape in command-bar

 - Document perferences

 - ide_layout_view_add_error() or similar
 - ide_layout_view_add_error_with_action() maybe so that we can
   specify a label and action name (reload for example) to possibly
   fix any sort of error.


Done

 - Check if buffer is already in visible stack before adding new view
 - Perspective actions, copy them across
 - Be able to add an editor view

 - Plugins to fix for API
